Setup libraries:
Setup->Paths->Library
Padpath to symbols
pmspath to symbols 
devpath to parts


Must in different product to do different things. Ex: Librarian to make parts. File->Change Product
Package symbol manager to make new package.
flows-> Library Management -> Part Developer
Then package symbol Wizard.
Go with bigger number in range for package size.
e1 is distance between centers of leads.
SOIC is surface mount.
Also usually says what size pads to use.
Tools->padstack->Select Library Padstack to change
Looking at the part from the top when editing.

Must make pins counterclockwise. Must move pins around. 12345678 counterclockwise.
Change pin names


Schematic: 
Change to-
penn b size page (add to every page)
One page for power
Anything analog on one page
Anything digital on another 

Component browser:
res is resistor. 402s and 603s are good. Good practice to have value and part number.




/GND to wire to make ground. Make this signal name

Knows anything with the same signal name is connected

When done, do file->export physical

Give name for file EX: simple test 1


Layout: Conductor, then dialectrics between, and then the planes in the middle, separated by dialectric
Cross-Section -> 
Place->Manually

Change visibility to see what layers you want to see.

Draw board with size.

Top colors red and bottom colors blue. Change color of the traces. Ground is green, and power is like yellow.
Silkscreen is colored slightly different. Bluer for bottom and pick for top.
Must make sizes and shapes, using dynamic copper, for the planes.

Allegro constraint manager to set up things early.

setup->constraints->constraint manager

Anything for ground and power, you want bigger vias (like size 40)

usually size 20 for power
lower for signal

What else:
Modules
Test points
